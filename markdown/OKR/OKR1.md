## How to make meetings more effectives with OKRs
OKR structure: a stethoscope, amplifying the heartbeat of an organization’s most important efforts.

OKR can help us understand what is the most important > why we have this meeting > what is important to do before the next one > give teams more rooms to focus on **real work** and **be in the zone**

* Focus on collective problem-solving
    * unearths questions
        * Why have we not made as much progress as we committed to by now?
        * can we stretch even more?
* Outcome, not activity
    * refine their meeting agendas
    * focus conversations on the important things.

* More focused meetings mean fewer (or shorter) meetings
    * how to “get in the zone.”
        * acknowledge the level of confidence in achieving each Key Result.
        * what was progressing well
        * get less confident outcomes back on track

## Activity vs outcomes
*High school Focused on improving how we can support students*

Why do you want to develop this data-focused approach? \
Once you develop it, what do you hope to do or hope will happen?
* What is your ultimate goal, here? 
    > * Better prepared teachers? 
    > * A flawless educational experience for students in the RtI program?

Objective should not only tell me what you want to do, but why you want to do it.

* Publish data about building behavioral data > 100% of staff knows how to build behavioral data into their work.
    >不要用動詞開頭

## Identifying Effective OKRs
* Our priorities for the next 30-90 days
* OKRs represent meaningful **meaningful  change**, **improvement** and **growth**
* Introducing disruptive innovations **connect to greater mission**
* Establishing differences between you and your competitors
* Being recognized as an industry leader in your category

### Reviewing effect Objectives with three guts check
* Is it **meaningful**? Is the Objective a top priority? Does it articulate a clear direction?
* Is it **audacious(bold)**? Does it represent a significant change from where we are today?
* Is it **inspiring**? Is the Objective easy to remember? Does it empower your teams?

### Reviewing effect Key Results with three guts check
Key Results need to support their attached Objective.
* Are they **specific and timebound**? Is it plainly stated what needs to occur and by when?
* Are they **aggressive, yet realistic**? Are they aspirational, yet not so outrageous that they could never be accomplished?
* Are they **measurable and verifiable**? Is it clear when the criteria for success will be met?
