# Login using SSH key
## SSH protocal
> The SSH (Secure Shell) protocal is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another.
> It provides several alternative options for strong authentication, and it protects the communications security and integrity with strong encryption.
> This protocal works in the client-server model, which means that connection is established by SSH client connect to SSH server.
## SSH key
> An SSH key is an access credential, similar to password, used in SSH protocal.
> The idea is to have a cryptographic key pair - public key and private key - and configure the public key on a server to authorize access and grant anyone who has a copy of the private key access to the server.
